You are designing a production-grade FastAPI microservice folder structure.

Inputs:
- service_name: {{{{service_name}}}}
- app_type: {{{{app_type}}}}
- description: {{{{description}}}}

Rules:
- Return ONLY valid JSON
- No markdown
- No explanations
- No extra keys

The JSON must follow this schema exactly:

{{
  "structure": {{
    "type": "folder",
    "name": "<service_name>",
    "description": "<what this service does>",
    "children": [
      {{
        "type": "folder",
        "name": "<folder name>",
        "description": "<purpose of this folder and its files>",
        "children": [
          {{ "type": "file", "name": "<file name>" }}
        ]
      }}
    ]
  }}
}}

Guidelines:
- Use realistic FastAPI architecture
- Include folders like apis, schemas, services, utils, core, etc where appropriate
- Use the description input to influence structure depth
- Every folder MUST include a high level description of its files and their usage - a detailed one
